During that time there have been countless growing pains and community has changed in an innumerable number of ways. At our heart however, Pterodactyl continues to exist for one purpose: to be <em>the</em> platform for running your game servers.</p><p>In order to keep true to that goal, and continue to foster one of the largest open-source game panel communities out there, we&#39;ve adopted a simple set of guidelines for participating in this community. The goal of these guidelines is to foster an inclusive, welcoming environment for new users, and provide a space for the thousands of existing users, administrators, network owners, and hosting companies to co-exist.</p><p>These rules and guidelines extend to all facets of the Pterodactyl Community, including but not limited to our Discord Server and all activities within the GitHub Organization.</p><h2 id="community-guidelines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#community-guidelines"><span>Community Guidelines</span></a></h2><p>At the most basic level, these guidelines can be distilled down to:</p><ol><li>Be a decent human.</li><li>Patience is a virtue.</li></ol><h3 id="be-mature" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#be-mature"><span>Be Mature</span></a></h3><p>You are expected to be mature and control your behavior in a manner that adheres to basic human decency.

Personal attacks, spam (in any form), &quot;doxxing&quot;, or otherwise acting out is not allowed.</p><p>This community is fairly lax in regards to moderating language. However, the following are some examples of behavior that is absolutely <em>not</em> tolerated and for which you will be removed from the community.</p><ul><li>Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise deregatory speech, images, insinuations, or any language whose sole purpose is to denigrate any individual, organization, or class of individual.</li><li>Threats of violence against any person, group, or organization including &quot;doxxing&quot; of these entities.</li><li>Pornographic or excessively violent content.</li></ul><h3 id="limit-the-drama" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#limit-the-drama"><span>Limit the Drama</span></a></h3><p>Discussion, including linking to or discussing sites or software, that exists to cast a negative image of other companies or users is not allowed.
